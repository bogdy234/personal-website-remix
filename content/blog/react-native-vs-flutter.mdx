## Cross platform frameworks

React Native and Flutter are both popular, open-source mobile app development frameworks.

## Why Cross-Platform Development?

Why #1: Because it is cheaper than native development. <br />
Why #2: Because the development takes up to 50% less time since you don’t need to develop for all target platforms. <br />
Why #3: Because it’s a good choice if you build prototypes to test several hypotheses. <br />
Why #4: Because developers don’t have to maintain native codebases for every operating system. <br />
Why #5: Because the necessary team size is reduced by 40%. <br />
Why #6: Because you spend less time on process management since the software development is more linear and consistent. <br />

# React Native Vs Flutter

## What languages do you need to know to develop in React Native and Flutter?

### React Native

Build natively rendered apps for Android, iOS, and other platforms with [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript):

-   Javascript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and was created in 1995
-   React Native and React can be used together to build powerful and user-friendly mobile apps

### Flutter

Build apps that can be compiled to native code for multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and the web with [Dart](https://dart.dev/):

-   Dart is an object-oriented programming language developed by Google first released in October 2011

## How about performance in React Native and Flutter?

### React Native

-   React uses JavaScript as a bridge to connect to native components.
-   The development and operating times are therefore slower than with Flutter.

### Flutter

-   The device's native elements cannot be contacted since there is no connecting bridge.
-   As a result, native component interactions are quicker, which enriches the application's overall speed.

## Market Trends

### React Native

-   In a recent 2022 StackOverflow loved vs dreaded survey, 55.98% of developers said they favored React Native.
-   React and JavaScript is used, and it has been around for a while, therefore it creates more job prospects.

### Flutter

-   In a recent 2022 StackOverflow loved vs dreaded survey, 68.03% of developers said they favored Flutter.

According to the Statista survey, in 2021 Flutter became the most popular cross-platform mobile framework used by global
developers. 42% of respondents said they use Flutter in the development, while the same rate for React Native counted 39%.

### Flutter

-   Flutter is aswell well-liked framework on Stack Overflow and is endorsed by a large community with over 148.441 tagged questions
-   It was first released as open-source on GitHub in 2017.

# So what to choose?

### Scenarios

It is only several scenarios when the answer to this question is almost unequivocal:

-   If you build native mobile design use React Native
-   If you expect a unified layouts across all platforms and operating systems use Flutter
-   If you target web and mobile it’s preferable to use React and React Native
-   If you target multiple platforms including small gadgets, TVs, embedded software, etc., use Flutter

# Who is using it?

More popular global companies using:

-   React Native: Bloomberg, Facebook, Uber Eats, Discord, Instagram, Skype, Pinterest, Salesforce, Baidu, Walmart, Wix, Shopify
-   Flutter: Google, eBay, BMW, Alibaba Group, The New York Times, Square, Tencent, Groupon, MGM Resorts, Philips Hue, Reflectly

# Conclusions

Overall, both Flutter and React Native are excellent choices for mobile app development. <br />
The best choice for a given project will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific requirements of the app, the expertise of the development team, and personal preferences.
