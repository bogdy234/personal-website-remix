# Theme

Let's talk about theming first.
This is the default theme and we gotta be honest, it's not that great.

  alt="default-theme"
/>

But that's not an issue because there are a lot of great themes out there. I will create a list of my
favorites so you can try them out and choose the one you like the most.

## Night Owl

Now this is a great theme. This is what I use as a daily driver and I love it.

  alt="night-owl-theme"
/>

It's a lot more easy on the eyes and it's a lot more fun to use.
It also has a nice combination of normal and italic font for different keywords and it works great with fonts that supports ligatures but we'll talk more about different [fonts](#fonts) and what ligatures are soon.

## Monokai Pro

Another great theme is Monokai Pro.

  alt="monokai-pro-theme"
/>

The only downside is that extended use of Monokai Pro requires a license, which can be purchased on [Monokai official website](https://monokai.pro).

## Community Material Theme Darker

If you don't like to see all those bright colors and you prefer a more minimalistic approach, you can try Community Material Theme Darker.

# Fonts

Now let's talk about fonts. There are a lot of great fonts out there and I will list some of my favorites.

## Dank Mono

This is what I use as a main font and I fell in love with it from the first time I tried it. It is a fun font to use, also has support for ligatures and
in combination with Night Owl theme it's just perfect. The only downside is that it costs Â£25. You can buy it from [here](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono).

## JetBrains Mono

On the next place we have JetBrains Mono that fortunately is free and open source. It also has support for ligatures.

Fira Code is another great font that is free and open source and has support for ligatures.

## Cascadia Code

Cascadia Code is a font from Microsoft that is also free and open source. It has support for ligatures aswell.
